                    <h1>MY PROJECTS</h1>
                    <p>"Hello, these are my projects, a testament to my passion and expertise in the field of machine learning and Python programming. My journey in the tech world has been marked by a deep fascination with the endless possibilities that data science and artificial intelligence offer. Throughout my career, I've honed my skills in machine learning and Python, pushing boundaries to create innovative solutions. A notable achievement includes spearheading the creation of 15 Python projects during my internship, all of which were published on Google under the company's website. These projects reflect my commitment to harnessing technology for real-world applications. As I continue to explore the ever-evolving landscape of data science, I'm excited about the limitless potential for impact and innovation."

                <h2>Facial Emotion Detection</h2>
                <div class="image main"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSC6UctoCj83bHMAN79KwsoXOmZbcdioS62Wg&usqp=CAU" alt="Project Image" style="max-width: 500px;" /></div>
                <p>"I implemented an expert system for Facial Emotion Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This technology has practical applications in improving customer experiences, product feedback, and security. The system achieved an impressive 92% accuracy and can be utilized in various fields, including marketing and emotion-related research. It holds the potential to enhance human-machine interfaces and even enable smart appliances to respond to facial expressions. The project utilized the FER2013 dataset and real-time Haar-Cascade Classifier for face detection, resulting in accurate emotion detection.    </p>

                <h2>AI based personality prediction and Resume screening</h2>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/project 2.jpg" alt="Project Image" style="max-width: 500px;" /></div>
                <p>'AI based personality prediction and Resume screening' project focuses on predicting personality traits using machine learning algorithms and analyzing resumes to match them with job descriptions. I have implemented models like OCEAN and MBTI for personality prediction, achieving an 88.75% accuracy rate with the Random Forest algorithm. Additionally, our web application, PersoAnalyzer, offers users the ability to assess their resumes and improve their job prospects by providing percentage matches with job descriptions. This project aims to assist students and job seekers in their personal and professional growth."</p>

                <h2>Face Eye Detector in ML</h2>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/project 3.jpeg" alt="Project Image" style="max-width: 500px;" /></div>
                <p>"Face and eye detection is a significant application of machine learning that plays a pivotal role in various fields. This technology employs advanced algorithms and deep learning models to identify and locate human faces and eyes within images or videos. It has extensive applications in security systems, video surveillance, facial recognition software, and even in the development of augmented reality experiences. Through the utilization of machine learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Haar Cascades, it's possible to accurately detect faces and eyes in real-time, making it a crucial tool for enhancing security and user experiences in today's technology-driven world."</p>
